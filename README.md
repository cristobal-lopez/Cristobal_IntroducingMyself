# Cristobal_IntroducingMyself

[A very motivated student on his way to becoming an impressive future programmer]
I am 29 years old and come from El Salvador, Central America. My mother tongue is Spanish and I also speak English and a little bit of Flemish. I moved to Belgium on 2021 and I am really happy to start a programming career here.

Some facts about me:

✈️Traveling is one of my favorite things in life

🏢I like museums

🏃Fitness life and healthy food are topics I am interested in

🙇I am an introverted person, but not an antisocial one at all!

And finally, one phrase that describes me:
"I am someone who likes trying and trying until a goal is accomplished"
